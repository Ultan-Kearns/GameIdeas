# Game Ideas

+ The Eternal - Space based game where you explore, upgrade spaceship, look for materials, grow fleet etc. Something like sunless sea with visual novel esque story telling

+ Football Fighters or The Local - Choose your fighter Big Dan, Harry the Half-wit, Mark the fixer, and Gaz the gowl.

+ Kenshi like game - messed up post apocalyptic 3d shooter with expanding world, base building, and in depth story.
